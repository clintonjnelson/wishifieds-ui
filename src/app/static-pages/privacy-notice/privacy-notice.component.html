</ul>

<br>
<h3>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h3>
<p>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or allow us to obtain via permission. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>

<p>We hold the right to manage or remove any site or user information at any time, should we deem necessary, e.g. if a user is misusing the site or entering unsafe content</p>

<p>We will use your information to respond to you and to provide an improved product & experience. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to display your requested information, enable you to verify your credibility, etc..</p>

<p>We may need to contact you via email to for reasons like confirmation of your registration, for when you request a password change, to inform you of activity on your wishes, to inform you of changes to this privacy notice or our terms & conditions, etc. Some optional automated interactions we allow you to opt out of, while others are only made at your request (eg: when you request a password change).</p>

<br>
<h3>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h3>
<p>You may opt out of future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address given on our website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See what personally identifable data we have about you, if any.</li>

<p>Some of these features can be managed by you directly from your settings section when you're logged in to our website.</p>


<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take security very seriously, and use precaution to protect your information.</p>

<p>Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page. We do not collect credit card information and will never request this from you on our website or via email. If you see such a request, it is not from us and you should regard it as a phishing attacker. <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/report-phishing">You can learn more about phishing here</a>.</p>

<p>We use secure algorithms to encrypt your password. This also means we have no way of retrieving and telling you your password. This is by design. If you forget your password or need to reset it, simply click the "forgot password" link in the signup/login area, and have a reset-password link sent to the email we have on record for you; once you receive the reset-password email, you can open it, and click the link inside to be redirected to our site where you can securely choose a new password.</p>

<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only authorized persons who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, to fix a problem in the site) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

<p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy notice, you should contact us immediately via email at wishifieds-support@gmail.com.</p>
